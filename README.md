# bar

this is my new status bar, its similar to my old one however i have ipdated the structure of the scripts and tried to make goo ddecisions abouthow to lay things out rather than frankenstiening code together like i have in the past.

Ideally i would like to update this to use interupts or something like that so that i dont need to keep checking these things at intervals and will just have to bar update dynamically when needed. This is a little our of my reach for most portions of this bar. 

Oh yeah, there are clickable areas :) the mostly open terminals with stuff in them... (why reinvent the wheel?)
