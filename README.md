# bar

This is my new status bar, it's similar to my old one however I have updated the structure of the scripts and tried to make good decisions about how to lay things out rather than "frankenstiening" code together like I have in the past.

Ideally I would like to update this to use interupts or something like that so that I don't need to keep checking these things at intervals and will just have to bar update dynamically when needed. This is a little our of my reach for most portions of this bar. 

Oh yeah, there are clickable areas :) the mostly open terminals with stuff in them... (why reinvent the wheel?)
